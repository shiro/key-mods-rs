**Welcome to map2**

Want to remap your input devices like keyboards, mice, controllers and more?  
There's nothing you can't remap with **map2**!

- **Blazingly fast, written in Rust**
- **Tiny install size (around 5Mb), almost no dependencies**
- **Highly configurable, using Python**
- **Remap keys, mouse events, controllers, pedals, and more!**



```python
import map2


# readers intercept all keyboard inputs and forward them
reader = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/my-keyboard"])
# mappers change inputs, you can also chain multiple mappers!
mapper = map2.Mapper()
# writers create new virtual devices we can write into
writer = map2.Writer(clone_from = "/dev/input/by-id/my-keyboard")
# finally, link nodes to control the event flow
map2.link([reader, mapper, writer])

# map the "a" key to "b"
mapper.map("a", "b")
```
