## Dependencies

You probably already have all the dependencies unless you're on a very minimal Linux setup.
Anyway, here's the list:

- Python 3 - all user scripts are written in Python
- XKB (`libxkbcommon`) - used by pretty much all distros for keyboard layout handling


## Install from PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install map2
```

It's safe to install globally, alternatively it also works in virtual envs.
