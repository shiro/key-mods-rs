## Dependencies

You probably already have all the dependencies unless you're on a very minimal Linux setup.
Anyway, here's the list:

- Python 3 - all user scripts are written in Python
- XKB (`libxkbcommon`) - used by pretty much all distros for keyboard layout handling


## Install from PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install map2
```

It's safe to install globally, alternatively it also works in virtual envs.



- add `etc/udev/rules.d/10-my-udev.rules`

```
groupadd map2

# create "map2" group
KERNEL=="event*", SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{hid}=="MYDEV000", MODE="0644", GROUP="map2", SYMLINK+="input/mydevice"

# add yourself to the "map2" group
$ usermod -aG `whoami` map2
```
