```python
import map2

writer = map2.VirtualWriter()

# send any text
writer.send("hello world")
# including really weird characters
writer.send("∇⋅∇ψ = ρ")
```

Creates a virtual output device that is able to type any text. It's different from a regular
[Writer](/map2/en/api/writer) in that it doesn't simulate a physical device, but rather sends text directly to the
desktop environment.

Supported on:

- ❌ X11
- ❌ Gnome (wayland)
