```python
import map2

# readers intercept all keyboard inputs and forward them
reader = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/my-keyboard"])
```



All devices matching a pattern will be *grabbed*, meaning all events will be intercepted by map2
and not forwarded to the system. If events are not passed to an output device such as [Writer](/map2/en/api/writer),
they will be lost, please avoid locking your only keyboard when testing.


Supported on:
- ✅ Hyprland
- ✅ X11
- ✅ Gnome (wayland)
- ✅ KDE plasma (wayland)


## Options


### patterns

```
string[]?
```

A list of file descriptors to intercept events from.

The patterns are regular expressions, if you are not familiar with them, consider reading a
[quick tutorial](https://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html).

Some quick examples:

- `/dev/input5`: The specific device on `/dev/input5`
- `/dev/input\d+`: All input devices
- `/dev/input/by-id/.*Gaming_Keyboard.*`: All devices who's ID contains `Gaming_Keyboard`
