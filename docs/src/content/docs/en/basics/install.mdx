## Using pip

It's safe to install the package globally, alternatively it also works in virtual envs.

```bash
pip install map2
```

## AUR (Arch user Repository)

Useful for people running Arch Linux, Manjaro, etc.

```bash
pacman -S python-map2
```

## Building from source

If you want to build the source code yourself, make sure you have `rust` and `cargo` installed
and clone the repository.

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shiro/map2.git
cd map2

# setup the environemnt
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install maturin patchelf

# run build
maturin develop
```
