## Install from PyPI 

```bash
pip install map2
```

It's safe to install globally, alternatively it also works in virtual envs.


## After installing

In most Linux setups, a regular user lacks the permissions to intercept input events for security reasons.
There are several ways to setup up map2:

### Lazy way

If you have superuser permissions, you can simply 

```bash
sudo python my-map2-script.py
```




Create a new group called `map2` and add the current user to it (this requires root permissions):
```bash
sudo groupadd map2
sudo usermod -aG `whoami` map2
```


Copy the following into `/etc/udev/rules.d/999-map2.rules`:

```
# Assign all input devices to the group 'map2' so all members have read rights
KERNEL=="*", SUBSYSTEM=="input", MODE="0644", GROUP="map2"
```



## Dependencies

You probably already have all the dependencies unless you're on a very minimal Linux setup.
Anyway, here's the list:

- Python 3 - all user scripts are written in Python
- XKB (`libxkbcommon`) - used by pretty much all distros for keyboard layout handling
