All of map2's functions that deal with mapping keys and emmiting virtual input events accept
a specific syntax for defining such events.

## Single keys

Let's look at an example, the [Mapper::map_key(key, key)](/map2/en/api/mapper) function:

```python
import map2

mapper = map2.Mapper()
mapper.map_key("a", "tab")
```

This function maps the "a" key to the "tab" key and expects a `key` type for both sides.
When functions expect a `key`, it means that only a single key with optional modifiers is allowed.

Passing in additional modifiers is possible by prepending the keys with one or more of the following special
characters:

- `^`: ctrl
- `!`: alt
- `+`: shift
- `#`: meta

Let's map `ALT + a` to `CTRL + tab`:

```python
import map2

mapper = map2.Mapper()

# "ALT + b" to "CTRL + tab"
mapper.map_key("!b", "^tab")

# if we want to map the "!" key, we need to escape it with "\"
mapper.map_key("\\!", "^tab")

# note that we used two "\" since it's a python string
```


## Key sequences

Sometimes functions accept more than one key, in which case we need to use the more explicit syntax.
Let's look at the [Mapper::map(key, key_sequence)](/map2/en/api/mapper) function:

```python
mapper.map("!a", "Hello!")
mapper.map("b", "{ctrl down}{tab}{ctrl up}")

# mixing regular characters with special ones is also allowed
mapper.map("#c", "type this and CTRL+w{ctrl down}w{ctrl up}")
```

Notice that the first argument is a `key` type while the second argument is a `key_sequence`.
The special modifier characters are treated as normal characters, instead there are only two
special characters in sequences: `{` and `}`.

Special keys now need to be surrounded by curly braces, i.e. "tab" becomes `{tab}`, which
will result in tab being pressed and released right after.

In many cases, we want a key to be held for some time, which can be achieved by specifying a
`state` after the key name, i.e. `{ctrl down}` will press the control key, but not release it.

Valid states are:
- `down`
- `up`
- `repeat`


## Special key list

Here's a list of all special key names you can use with `{KEY_NAME}`.
