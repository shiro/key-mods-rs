A map2 script is simply a python file that uses the map2 package. There are many good python tutorials
out there, for example the [W3Schools python tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python).

## Running a script

In most Linux setups, a regular user lacks the permissions to intercept input events for security reasons.
If you have superuser permissions, you can simply run your script as the superuser
(the `-E` flag is important to run in the current environment).

```bash
sudo -E python my-map2-script.py
```

This is somewhat risky as the script has access to copy your data, modify files and even remove system files.
Use this method only for code you trust or have written yourself!

For a more secure setup see the [Secure setup](/map2/en/advanced/secure-setup) section.

## Input devices

On Linux, all connected input devices are listed in `/dev/inputX` where `X` is a number.
To get more information about a device (label, ID, etc.), the following command can be used:

```bash
udevadm info -q all -a /dev/inputX
```

Some devices will also show up in `/dev/input/by-id` and `/dev/input/by-path`. This devices
are just symbolic links to the appropriate `/dev/inputX` device, but with more
descriptive names.



## My first map2 script

Now that we know which input device we want to map on, let's write a short python script!

```python
import time
import map2

# readers intercept all keyboard inputs and forward them
reader = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/my-keyboard"])

# mappers change inputs, you can also chain multiple mappers!
mapper = map2.Mapper()

# writers create new virtual devices we can write into
writer = map2.Writer(clone_from = "/dev/input/by-id/my-keyboard")

# finally, link nodes to control the event flow
map2.link([reader, mapper, writer])

mapper.map("a", "hello world")

# keep running for 7 seconds
time.sleep(7)
```

After running the script, pressing the `a` key should emmit `hello world` instead!
