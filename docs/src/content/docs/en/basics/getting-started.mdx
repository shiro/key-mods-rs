A map2 script is simply a python file that uses the map2 package. There are many good python tutorials
out there, for example the [W3Schools python tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python).

## Running a script

In most Linux setups, a regular user lacks the permissions to intercept input events for security reasons.
If you have superuser permissions, you can simply run your script as the superuser.

```bash
sudo python my-map2-script.py
```

This is somewhat risky as the script has access to copy your data, modify files and even remove system files.
Use this method only for code you trust or have written yourself!

For a more secure setup see the [Secure setup](/map2/en/advanced/secure-setup) section.


## My first map2 script

Let's look at a simple script and go through the basics.


```python
import map2



```
