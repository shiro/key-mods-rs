**Welcome to map2**

Want to remap your input devices like keyboards, mice, controllers and more?  
There's nothing you can't remap with **map2**!

- 🖱️ **Remap keys, mouse events, controllers, pedals, and more!**
- 🔧  **Highly configurable**, using Python
- 🚀 **Blazingly fast**, written in Rust
- 📦 **Tiny install size** (around 5Mb), almost no dependencies
- ❤️ **Open source**, made with love

Let's look at an example:


```python
import map2

# readers intercept all keyboard inputs and forward them
reader = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/my-keyboard"])
# mappers change inputs, you can also chain multiple mappers!
mapper = map2.Mapper()
# writers create new virtual devices we can write into
writer = map2.Writer(clone_from = "/dev/input/by-id/my-keyboard")
# finally, link nodes to control the event flow
map2.link([reader, mapper, writer])

# map the "a" key to "B"
mapper.map("a", "B")

# map "CTRL + ALT + u" to "META + SHIFT + w"
mapper.map("^!u", "#+w")

# key sequences are also supported
mapper.map("s", "hello world!")

# use the full power of Python using functions
def custom_function(key, state):
  print("called custom function")

  # custom conditions and complex sequences
  if key == "d":
    return "{ctrl down}a{ctrl up}"
  return True

mapper.map("d", custom_function)
```
