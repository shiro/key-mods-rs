description: 'Routing using map2: define the input event flow'
---

Routing in map2 refers to linking nodes such as [Reader](/map2/en/api/reader) and [Writer](/map2/en/api/writer),
defining the input event flow chain.

Let's look at a basic example:


```python
import map2

reader_kbd = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard"])
reader_mouse = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/example-mouse"])

mapper_kbd = map2.Mapper()
mapper_mouse = map2.Mapper()

writer_kbd = map2.Writer(clone_from = "/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard")
writer_mouse = map2.Writer(clone_from = "/dev/input/by-id/example-mouse")

map2.link([reader_kbd, mapper_kbd, writer_kbd])
map2.link([reader_mouse, mapper_mouse, writer_mouse])
```

Here, we define two separate event chains, one for each input device, routing events
from the respective reader, through a mapper and to a writer.

## Nodes

Each object that can be placed in a chain is called a node.

There exist 3 types of nodes:

- **input**: needs to be at the beginning of a chain
- **passthrough**: can't be at the beginning or end of a chain
- **output**: needs to be at the end of a chain

A good example for the 3 types of nodes are [Reader](/map2/en/api/reader),
[Mapper](/map2/en/api/mapper) and [Writer](/map2/en/api/writer) respectively.


### Input nodes

Input nodes collect input events, either from a physical device or from
other inputs, and pass them on to the next node in the chain.

Currently every input node can only appear in a **single chain**.
This means the following code is invalid:

```python
import map2

reader = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard"])
writer1 = map2.Writer(clone_from = "/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard1")
writer2 = map2.Writer(clone_from = "/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard1")

# error: every reader can only appear in a single chain
map2.link([reader, writer1])
map2.link([reader, writer2])
```

### Passthrough nodes

Passthrough nodes receive input events from the previous node in the chain,
and pass them on to the next node in the chain, potentially modifying,
removing or creating new input events.

A passtrhough node can appear in more than one chain at a time, let's look at
an example:

```python
import map2

reader1 = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard-1"])
reader2 = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard-1"])
mapper = map2.Mapper()
writer1 = map2.Writer(clone_from = "/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard-1")
writer2 = map2.Writer(clone_from = "/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard-1")

map2.link([reader1, mapper, writer1])
map2.link([reader2, mapper, writer2])
```

In this example, events from `reader1` flow through `mapper` and into `writer1`, while
events from `reader2` flow through `mapper` into `writer2`.

An important thing to note is, that the modifier state for each chain is separate, i.e.
emmiting `shift down` from `reader1` does not affect the mapping behaviour of
inputs coming from `reader2`.

It's also possible to chain multiple passthrough nodes.

```python
import map2

reader = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard-1"])
mapper1 = map2.Mapper()
mapper2 = map2.Mapper()
mapper3 = map2.Mapper()
writer = map2.Writer(clone_from = "/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard-1")

map2.link([reader, mapper1, mapper2, mapper3, writer])
```

This can be useful for creating *mapping layers*, where each layer maps independently
on the inputs received from the previous layer.

### Output nodes

Output nodes consume events and usually pass them to a physical device, to the destop
environment, etc.

Linking multiple chains to an output node is allowed, let's look at an example:

```python
import map2

reader1 = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard-1"])
reader2 = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard-1"])
writer = map2.Writer(clone_from = "/dev/input/by-id/example-keyboard-1")

map2.link([reader1, writer])
map2.link([reader2, writer])
```

In this example, a single writer consumes events from multiple chains.
