description: 'Setup map2 in a more secure way'

As discussed in the [Getting started](map2/en/basics/getting-started) section, running your script with
superuser access is not ideal since it allows the script to steal your data, modify your system or
remove system files. This is especially risky when running code that you haven't written yourself.

## Setting things up

The more secure (and complicated) approach is to create a new user that has exclusive ownership of the
script files and is allowed to intercept events from input devices.
This way, even if a user account gets compromised, it would not be possible to tamper with script files
or spy on input devices.



The initial setup requires superuser access, ask your local system administrator for help if necessary.


Create a new system user called `map2` and set a secure password for it:

```bash
# add a new system user called 'map2', also create a home directory
sudo useradd -rm -s /bin/sh map2
# allow it to intercept input device events
sudo usermod -aG input map2
# set a secure password for the new user
sudo passwd map2
```

If you have an existing script, transfer the ownership to the `map2` user and remove all permissions
to the file for other users, so others can't read/modify the script.
We should also move the script to `/home/map2` in order to avoid permission issues.

```bash
# transfer all ownership, remove access for other users
sudo chown map2:map2 my-map2-script.py
sudo chmod 700 my-map2-script.py
# move the script to a location owned by the map2 user
sudo mv my-map2-script.py /home/map2
```


Copy the following into `/etc/udev/rules.d/999-map2.rules`:

```
# Allow the 'input' group to manipulate input events
SUBSYSTEM=="misc", KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"
```


### Running the script


Now any user can run the script without superuser access, as long as they know the password for the
`map2` user. You can even modify the script that way.

```bash
su map2 -pc 'python ~/my-map2-script.py'
```


## Optional extra steps

It's also possible to allow the `map2` user access to only specific input devices rather than all of them.
This is optional and usually not required unless security is very important.

Change the contents of `/etc/udev/rules.d/999-map2.rules` to:

```
# Allow the 'map2' group to manipulate input events
SUBSYSTEM=="misc", KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="map2"

# Assign specific input devices to the group 'map2'
ATTRS{name}=="Gaming Keyboard", SUBSYSTEM=="input", MODE="0644", GROUP="map2"
```

And modify the filter rules to match the devices you want to grant access to. There are lots of
guides describing udev rules, for example the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/udev)
explains it pretty well.

Finally reload the configuration and adjust the permissions.

```bash
# reload the udev rules since we modified them
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger

# remove the map2 user from the input group
sudo gpasswd -d map2 input


```
