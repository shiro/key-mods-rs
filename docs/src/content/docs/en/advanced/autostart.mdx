A common use case for map2 is to run a script automatically after logging in, the way
to do it depends on your Linux distro and system setup.

This section is work in progress, check back soon!

{/*
## Preperation


In the following command, replace `/path/to/script.py` with your script path and run it.

```bash
echo "ALL ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:SETENV: /usr/bin/python /path/to/script.py" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers
```

## Systemd

Most distros come with [Systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd), which allows
setting up services that run commands automatically.

### Basic setup


Edit `/etc/systemd/system/map2.service`:


```
[Unit]
Description=map2 autostart service
PartOf=graphical-session.target

[Service]
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s
ExecStart=sudo -E python /path/to/script.py

[Install]
WantedBy=xsession.target
```


Now that we created a service, we need to make sure it works and enable it so it starts automatically.

```bash
# tell systemd we edited a service
systemctl --user daemon-reload

# start the service and make sure it runs the script
systemctl --user start map2

# after ensuring it works, enable it so it runs on every startup
systemctl --user enable map2
```


### Secure setup

First, let's create a file `~/.config/systemd/user/map2.service` with the following contents,
also provide your own script path.

```
[Unit]
Description=map2 autostart service
PartOf=graphical-session.target

[Service]
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s
ExecStart=sudo -E python /home/me/path/to/my/script.py

[Install]
WantedBy=xsession.target
```

Now that we created a service, we need to make sure it works and enable it so it starts automatically.

```bash
# tell systemd we edited a service
systemctl --user daemon-reload

# start the service and make sure it runs the script
systemctl --user start map2

# after ensuring it works, enable it so it runs on every startup
systemctl --user enable map2
```

Your script should now run automatically
