Allows moving the mouse by binding the WASD directional keys to functions
that emmit mouse move events.

This script uses a custom interval implementation to control how much the mouse
should be moved. An alternative approach would be binding the WASD `repeat` state
to move the mouse every time a `repeat` key event is received.
