To emmit custom events, we need an output device, so we create a virtual one using [Writer](/map2/en/api/writer).
The device needs the `keys` capability in order to emmit keyboard key events.

Since we don't want to intercept a physical input device, but instead send events
programatically, we create a [Reader](/map2/en/api/reader).

Finally we need to link the input and output devices, so events can flow.
